# Resume 

Let's begin!

The first document we will build is your *resume*. Think of it as the first impression you'll make on recruiters. Recruiters will skim your resume to see if your accomplishments align with the qualifications of the job description.

This tutorial will teach you how to create a resume that will stand out of the crowd.

Let's make it even better.

Keep improving your resume until you check all the boxes.

# Circle challenge
Let's improve our resume further.

Since recruiters skim resumes, it's useful if the _syntax_ in your resume matches the _syntax_ in the job description. For example, do the description use the word "coding" "developing" or "programming"? You can get a small leg up by matching your language choice to theirs. Of course, you don't want to do this for every single company. But you may see a _trend_ in the terminology used across the industry it may be worth matching your language.

Let's match the verbs in our resume with the verbs in job descriptions:
1. Circle the skill based verbs in your own resume.
1. Print out a few job descriptions that interest you. Circle the all the skill based verbs in the job descriptions. This may be "develop" "design" "collaborate." Also circle the industry jargon terms mentioned such as "UI/UX," "MVC," and "Object Oriented Programming."
1. Note if you see a trend in syntax among job descriptions
1. Replace your verbs with the trend verbs

This is a tip to give you a small leg up in the job search.

The more your resume speaks directly to job descriptions, the better.
